# trim and spritesheet maker

This code trim your pictures and then converts them into spritesheet.

You need to:

1. Install Python 3
2. Install Pillow module (pip3 install pillow)
3. Add your images to "images_folder"
	(The style of the name of the images should look like this:
	image_01.png, image_02.png, image_03.png, etc)
4. Run code
5. Get trimmed images in "trims_folder"
6. Get your spritesheet from the folder where the code is in it. (root directory)

You could change the "COL_MAX" variable for the column number of spritesheet.

The source of images inside the "images_folder" is [here](https://www.gameart2d.com/cute-girl-free-sprites.html)
